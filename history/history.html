            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Cebu City, located in the Philippines, boasts a rich history that spans centuries. From its pre-colonial
                roots as the home of the Sugboanon people to its pivotal role in the Spanish colonization of the
                Philippines, Cebu has long been a center of trade, culture, and religion in the region. <br></br>
                Under Spanish rule, it became the site of the first European settlement in the Philippines, flourishing
                as a hub for maritime trade and Christianity. The arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in
                1521 marked a significant turning point, as it led to the conversion of the local ruler, Rajah Humabon,
                to Christianity. However, conflicts ensued, including the famous Battle of Mactan where Magellan was
                killed. <br></br>
                Despite this setback, the Spanish eventually established control over Cebu in 1565, laying the
                foundations for colonial rule. Cebu continued to thrive as an important trading center during the
                Spanish colonial period, with the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade further boosting its economic
                significance. In the 20th century, Cebu experienced both the challenges of World War II, including the
                Japanese occupation, and the opportunities of American colonization, which brought modernization and
                infrastructure development. Since gaining independence in 1946, Cebu City has undergone rapid
                urbanization and growth, emerging as a dynamic economic and cultural hub in the Visayas. <br></br>
                Today, it is celebrated for its diverse economy, historical landmarks, vibrant festivals, and warm
                hospitality, making it a must-visit destination in the Philippines.
